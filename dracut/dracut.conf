# This services should be run from immucore directly, rootfs once we mount /sysroot and initramfs once we mount everything,
# so at the end, just before we let init do the switch_root. Notice that we run really early in the boot with immucore so
# maybe by this time some things are not ready...
# Note that initramfs run with RootDirectory=/sysroot
